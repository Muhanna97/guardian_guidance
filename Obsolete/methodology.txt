have a main loop that runs at a minimum of 10Hz or something
  check if last time is within .1 sec,

  In it, go to waypoints in the search pattern, check the obstacle location
  move if obstacle is there


-------------- issues
it kind of hangs when it is at the last point in the list


------------------- todo
get the functions into a library
for waypoint proximity, do based on derivative instead of counter
implement RTOS loop style thing


------ mavproxy hack to show icons:
display_waypoints function in mavproxy/modules/mavproxy_map/__init__.py
add_object function in mavproxy/modules/mavproxy_map/mp_slipmap.py
