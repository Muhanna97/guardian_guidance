---------------- Do once -------------------
1. Install APM SITL: http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/setting-up-sitl-on-linux.html
2. Install DroneKit http://python.dronekit.io/develop/installation.html


3. Add the surrey field to locations.txt in ardupilot/Tools/autotest with the following line:
    SRY=49.128645,-122.7965086,100,0


-------------------- Running the Script --------------------
1. In a terminal window, cd to ardupilot/Tools/autotest

2. run:
    python sim_vehicle.py -w -v ArduCopter --console --map --location SRY

3. Open a new window, cd to dronekit-python/guardian
4. run:
    python guided_v7.py --connect 127.0.0.1:14551
5. Currently, the script doesn't exit cleanly
    ctrl+c to kill it :D

-------------------------- How it works ------------------
The dronekit api lets creates MAVLink commands to control or get information from the vehicle.
MAVProxy takes the MAVLink stream to/from the vehicle and lets us connect to it with Dronekit and APM planner.

The script cooperatively schedules two tasks - checking for obstacles, and sending vehicle commands.
To fly towards a waypoint, a bearing is calculated between the drone and the waypoint.
Then, the North and East velocity components of the vehicle are changed to head along this bearing.
When the drone is close to the object, a goto command is sent. This uses the standard waypoint navigation control system, so automatically slows the drone down as it approaches the waypoint
This prevents us from having to make our own control system.

If the drone is close to an obstacle, the velocity vector is changed to curve around the obstacle.
When it has passed and avoided the obstacle, it continues to head towards the current waypoint.

When all waypoints have been reached, the vehicle will RTL.

There is lots of logic to check that we're in the right mode.
The script will only send velocity commands to the drone if it is in GUIDED mode, which the script places it in by default.
This means that we can switch the drone to RTL, STABILIZE, etc. at any time (using the RC controller or APM planner), to stop the script from having control. This prevents bad things from happening.


---------------------- Relevant sections -------------------
The step method in the checkObstacle and gotoGuardian3 classes are run repeatedly by the scheduler, according to the scheduled frequency of the task
The code that matters starts around line 420. Above is just a bunch of funtions that will be split into a package elsewhere.

Some useful user params are on line 593 ish
The obstacle location is on line 538 ish
